Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way for some people to _______________. 


To test this idea, Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave participants false feedback about their test performance, and then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as the next part of the study. 


When the video came on, showing nature scenes with a musical soundtrack, the experimenter exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly to get the correct one, leaving the participant alone as the video played. 


The participants who had received failure feedback watched the video much longer than those who thought they had succeeded. 


The researchers concluded that distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches between the self and self-guides. 


In contrast, successful participants had little wish to be distracted from their self-related thoughts!
