Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to bringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of the commons. 


She pointed out, for instance, that the actors affected by the rules for the use and care of resources must have the right to ________________. 


For that reason, the people who monitor and control the behavior of users should also be users and/or have been given a mandate by all users. 


This is a significant insight, as it shows that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the problem of the commons coming from a state power in comparison with a local solution for which users assume personal responsibility. 


Ostrom also emphasizes the importance of democratic decision processes and that all users must be given access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts among themselves. 


Political institutions at central, regional, and local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations and independently ensure observance.
