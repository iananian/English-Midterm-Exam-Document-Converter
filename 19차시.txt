Enabling animals to _______________ is an almost universal function of learning. 


Most animals innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered. 


Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous; treating them with caution has survival value. 


If persisted in, however, such careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution would be lost. 


A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never win races, not even with a lazy rabbit. 


To overcome this problem, almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur frequently. 


Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. 


The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile.
