In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity production, collection, and redistribution. 


The discovery of administrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance. 


Given the lack of archaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is not clear whether individuals also used the system for ____________. 


For that matter, it is not clear how widespread literacy was at its beginnings. 


The use of identifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is consistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was mutually intelligible by literate and nonliterate parties. 


As cuneiform script became more abstract, literacy must have become increasingly important to ensure one understood what he or she had agreed to.
