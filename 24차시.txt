Digital technology accelerates dematerialization by hastening the migration from products to services. 


The liquid nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to materials. 


But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. 


The reason even solid physical goods — like a soda can — can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. 


The tangible is replaced by intangibles — intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity — that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. 


Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. 


Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if ________________. 


Nouns morph to verbs. 


Hardware behaves like software. 


In Silicon Valley they say it like this: “Software eats everything. ”
