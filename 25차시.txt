Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over time. 


The negative version instructs restraint; the positive encourages intervention. 


One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior. 


While examples of these rules abound, too many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and “Love another as yourself. ” 


Both versions insist on caring for others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or through acts of commission, by actively intervening. 


Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, they _______________. 


The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self-referential. 


Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated.
