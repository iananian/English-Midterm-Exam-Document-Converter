More than just having territories, animals also partition them. 


And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for zoo husbandry. 


An animal’s territory has an internal arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a person’s house. 


Most of us assign separate functions to separate rooms, but even if you look at a one-room house you will find the same internal specialization. 


In a cabin or a mud hut, or even a Mesolithic cave from 30,000 years ago, this part is for cooking, that part is for sleeping; this part is for making tools and weaving, that part is for waste.

To a varying extent, other animals do the same. 


A part of an animal’s territory is for eating, a part for sleeping, a part for swimming or wallowing, a part may be set aside for waste, depending on the species of animal.
