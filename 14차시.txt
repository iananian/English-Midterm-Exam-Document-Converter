Thanks to newly developed neuroimaging technology, we now have access to the specific brain changes that occur during learning. 


Even though all of our brains contain the same basic structures, our neural networks are as unique as our fingerprints. 


The latest developmental neuroscience research has shown that the brain is much more malleable throughout life than previously assumed; it develops in response to its own processes, to its immediate and distant “environments,” and to its past and current situations. 


The brain seeks to create meaning through establishing or refining existing neural networks. 


When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons communicate to form networks of connected information. 


Using this knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow similar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently than others. 


High-activity synaptic connections are stabilized and strengthened, while connections with relatively low use are weakened and eventually pruned. 


In this way, our brains are ________________.
