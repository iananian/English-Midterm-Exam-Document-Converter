When examining the archaeological record of human culture, one has to consider that it is vastly __________. 


Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. 


Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. 


Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. 


It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. 


Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. 


Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems.
