Protopia is a state of becoming, rather than a destination. 


It is a process. 


In the protopian mode, things are better today than they were yesterday, although only a little better. 


It is incremental improvement or mild progress. 


The “pro” in protopian stems from the notions of process and progress. 


This subtle progress is not dramatic, not exciting. 


It is easy to miss because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as new benefits. 


The problems of today were caused by yesterday’s technological successes, and the technological solutions to today’s problems will cause the problems of tomorrow. 


This circular expansion of both problems and solutions ________________. 


Ever since the Enlightenment and the invention of science, we’ve managed to create a tiny bit more than we’ve destroyed each year. 


But that few percent positive difference is compounded over decades into what we might call civilization. 


Its benefits never star in movies.
