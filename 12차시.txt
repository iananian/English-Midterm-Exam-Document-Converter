Some of the most insightful work on information seeking emphasizes “strategic self-ignorance,” understood as “the use of ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable activities that may be harmful to one’s future self. ” 


The idea here is that if people are present-biased, they might avoid information that would _______________ —perhaps because it would produce guilt or shame, perhaps because it would suggest an aggregate trade-off that would counsel against engaging in such activities. 


St. Augustine famously said, “God give me chastity— tomorrow. ” 


Present-biased agents think: “Please let me know the risks —tomorrow. ” 


Whenever people are thinking about engaging in an activity with short-term benefits but long-term costs, they might prefer to delay receipt of important information. 


The same point might hold about information that could make people sad or mad: “Please tell me what I need to know—tomorrow. ”
