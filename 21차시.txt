Since human beings are at once both similar and different, they should be treated equally because of both. 


Such a view, which grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of uniformity and difference, builds difference into the very concept of equality, breaks the traditional equation of equality with similarity, and is immune to monist distortion. 


Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. 


Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. 


When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. 


Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs might ______________ in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights. 


Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is commonly argued, but also full recognition of legitimate and relevant ones.
