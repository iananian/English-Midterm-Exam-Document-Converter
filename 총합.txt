There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. 


In discharging their usual responsibilities of description and commentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly consulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are among the most visible of all contemporary writers. 


The ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism. 


Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do. 


This reluctance to take sports journalism seriously produces the paradoxical outcome that sports newspaper writers are much read but little ________________.

People have always wanted to be around other people and to learn from them. 


   Cities have long been dynamos of social possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. 


   Slang, or, if you prefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities—an outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to one another. 


   It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike transmissible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. 


   If, as the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then language innovation would happen where the most people heard and talked to the most other people. 


   Cities drive taste change because they ________________, who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem to attract. 


   Media, ever more global, ever more far-reaching, spread language faster to more people.

More than just having territories, animals also partition them. 


And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for zoo husbandry. 


An animal’s territory has an internal arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a person’s house. 


Most of us assign separate functions to separate rooms, but even if you look at a one-room house you will find the same internal specialization. 


In a cabin or a mud hut, or even a Mesolithic cave from 30,000 years ago, this part is for cooking, that part is for sleeping; this part is for making tools and weaving, that part is for waste. 


We keep ________________. 


To a varying extent, other animals do the same. 


A part of an animal’s territory is for eating, a part for sleeping, a part for swimming or wallowing, a part may be set aside for waste, depending on the species of animal.

Fans feel for feeling’s own sake. 


They make meanings beyond what seems to be on offer. 


They build identities and experiences, and make artistic creations of their own to share with others. 


A person can be an individual fan, feeling an “idealized connection with a star, strong feelings of memory and nostalgia,” and engaging in activities like “collecting to develop a sense of self. ” 


But, more often, individual experiences are embedded in social contexts where other people with shared attachments socialize around the object of their affections. 


Much of the pleasure of fandom________________. 


In their diaries, Bostonians of the 1800s described being part of the crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance. 


A compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less the object of their fandom than the attachments to (and differentiations from) one another that those affections afford.

Young contemporary artists who employ digital technologies in their practice rarely make reference to computers. 


  For example, Wade Guyton, an abstractionist who uses a word processing program and inkjet printers, does not call himself a computer artist. 


  Moreover, some critics, who admire his work, are little concerned about his extensive use of computers in the art-making process. 


  This is a marked contrast from three decades ago when artists who utilized computers were labeled by critics—often disapprovingly—as computer artists. 


  For the present generation of artists, the computer, or more appropriately, the laptop, is one in a collection of integrated, portable digital technologies that link their social and working life. 


  With tablets and cell phones surpassing personal computers in Internet usage, and as slim digital devices resemble nothing like the room-sized mainframes and bulky desktop computers of previous decades, it now appears that the computer artist is finally _________.

The critic who wants to write about literature from a formalist perspective must first be a close and careful reader who examines all the elements of a text individually and questions how they come together to create a work of art. 


 Such a reader, who respects the autonomy of a work, achieves an understanding of it by ________________. 


 Instead of examining historical periods, author biographies, or literary styles, for example, he or she will approach a text with the assumption that it is a self-contained entity and that he or she is looking for the governing principles that allow the text to reveal itself. 


 For example, the correspondences between the characters in James Joyce’s short story “Araby” and the people he knew personally may be interesting, but for the formalist they are less relevant to understanding how the story creates meaning than are other kinds of information that the story contains within itself.

Humour involves not just practical disengagement but cognitive disengagement. 


As long as something is funny, we are for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or fictional, true or false. 


This is why we give considerable leeway to people telling funny stories. 


If they are getting extra laughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by making up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic licence, a kind of poetic licence. 


Indeed, someone listening to a funny story who tries to correct the teller—‘No, he didn’t spill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the keyboard’—will probably be told by the other listeners to stop interrupting. 


The creator of humour is putting ideas into people’s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to provide ________________ information.

News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not only by its choice of topics and stories but by its ________________. 


Presentational styles have been subject to a tension between an informational educational purpose and the need to engage us entertainingly. 


While current affairs programmes are often ‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more popular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which we are invited to consider the impact of particular news items from the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. 


Indeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an increased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational styles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts and the ‘star quality’ of news readers. 


Popular formats can be said to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling to endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. 


However, they arguably work to reduce understanding by failing to provide the structural contexts for news events.

When examining the archaeological record of human culture, one has to consider that it is vastly __________. 


Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. 


Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. 


Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. 


It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. 


Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. 


Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems.

Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way for some people to _______________. 


To test this idea, Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave participants false feedback about their test performance, and then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as the next part of the study. 


When the video came on, showing nature scenes with a musical soundtrack, the experimenter exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly to get the correct one, leaving the participant alone as the video played. 


The participants who had received failure feedback watched the video much longer than those who thought they had succeeded. 


The researchers concluded that distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches between the self and self-guides. 


In contrast, successful participants had little wish to be distracted from their self-related thoughts! 11차시


The growth of academic disciplines and subꠓdisciplines, such as art history or palaeontology, and of particular figures such as the art critic, helped produce principles and practices for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping, though it remained a struggle. 


Moreover, as museums and universities drew further apart toward the end of the nineteenth century, and as the idea of objects as a highly valued route to knowing the world went into decline, collecting began to lose its status as a worthy intellectual pursuit, especially in the sciences. 


The really interesting and important aspects of science were increasingly those invisible to the naked eye, and the classification of things collected no longer promised to produce cutting-edge knowledge. 


The term “butterfly collecting” could come to be used with the adjective “mere” to indicate a pursuit of ___________ academic status.

Some of the most insightful work on information seeking emphasizes “strategic self-ignorance,” understood as “the use of ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable activities that may be harmful to one’s future self. ” 


The idea here is that if people are present-biased, they might avoid information that would _______________ —perhaps because it would produce guilt or shame, perhaps because it would suggest an aggregate trade-off that would counsel against engaging in such activities. 


St. Augustine famously said, “God give me chastity— tomorrow. ” 


Present-biased agents think: “Please let me know the risks —tomorrow. ” 


Whenever people are thinking about engaging in an activity with short-term benefits but long-term costs, they might prefer to delay receipt of important information. 


The same point might hold about information that could make people sad or mad: “Please tell me what I need to know—tomorrow. ”

In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity production, collection, and redistribution. 


The discovery of administrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance. 


Given the lack of archaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is not clear whether individuals also used the system for ____________. 


For that matter, it is not clear how widespread literacy was at its beginnings. 


The use of identifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is consistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was mutually intelligible by literate and nonliterate parties. 


As cuneiform script became more abstract, literacy must have become increasingly important to ensure one understood what he or she had agreed to.

Thanks to newly developed neuroimaging technology, we now have access to the specific brain changes that occur during learning. 


Even though all of our brains contain the same basic structures, our neural networks are as unique as our fingerprints. 


The latest developmental neuroscience research has shown that the brain is much more malleable throughout life than previously assumed; it develops in response to its own processes, to its immediate and distant “environments,” and to its past and current situations. 


The brain seeks to create meaning through establishing or refining existing neural networks. 


When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons communicate to form networks of connected information. 


Using this knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow similar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently than others. 


High-activity synaptic connections are stabilized and strengthened, while connections with relatively low use are weakened and eventually pruned. 


In this way, our brains are ________________.

Manufacturers design their innovation processes around the way they think the process works. 


The vast majority of manufacturers still think that product development and service development are always done by manufacturers, and that their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that ________________. 


Accordingly, manufacturers have set up market-research departments to explore the needs of users in the target market, product-development groups to think up suitable products to address those needs, and so forth. 


The needs and prototype solutions of lead users—if encountered at all—are typically rejected as outliers of no interest. 


Indeed, when lead users’ innovations do enter a firm’s product line—and they have been shown to be the actual source of many major innovations for many firms—they typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic route.

Development can get very complicated and fanciful. 


A fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process could go, when a single melodic line, sometimes just a handful of notes, was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent structure. 


Ludwig van Beethoven’s famous Fifth Symphony provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping. 


The opening da-da-da-DUM that everyone has heard somewhere or another ________________ throughout not only the opening movement, but the remaining three movements, like a kind of motto or a connective thread. 


Just as we don’t always see the intricate brushwork that goes into the creation of a painting, we may not always notice how Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he develops his material into a large, cohesive statement. 


But a lot of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from the inventiveness behind it, the impressive development of musical ideas.

Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to bringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of the commons. 


She pointed out, for instance, that the actors affected by the rules for the use and care of resources must have the right to ________________. 


For that reason, the people who monitor and control the behavior of users should also be users and/or have been given a mandate by all users. 


This is a significant insight, as it shows that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the problem of the commons coming from a state power in comparison with a local solution for which users assume personal responsibility. 


Ostrom also emphasizes the importance of democratic decision processes and that all users must be given access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts among themselves. 


Political institutions at central, regional, and local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations and independently ensure observance.

Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for all meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences is, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever greater precision. 


But historical representation puts a premium on a proliferation of representations, hence not on the refinement of one representation but on the production of an ever more varied set of representations. 


Historical insight is not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the contrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. 


It therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of determinacy and precision by the production of new and alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those previous representations. 


And from this perspective, the development of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the outsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous questioning of ________________, rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation to the truth.

Enabling animals to _______________ is an almost universal function of learning. 


Most animals innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered. 


Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous; treating them with caution has survival value. 


If persisted in, however, such careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution would be lost. 


A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never win races, not even with a lazy rabbit. 


To overcome this problem, almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur frequently. 


Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. 


The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile.

Concepts of nature are always cultural statements. 


This may not strike Europeans as much of an insight, for Europe’s landscape is so much of a blend. 


But in the new worlds—‘new’ at least to Europeans—the distinction appeared much clearer not only to European settlers and visitors but also to their descendants. 


For that reason, they had the fond conceit of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations which could later find expression in an admiration for wilderness. 


Ecological relationships certainly have their own logic and in this sense ‘nature’ can be seen to have a self-regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent of human intervention. 


But the context for ecological interactions _________________. 


We may not determine how or what a lion eats but we certainly can regulate where the lion feeds.

Since human beings are at once both similar and different, they should be treated equally because of both. 


Such a view, which grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of uniformity and difference, builds difference into the very concept of equality, breaks the traditional equation of equality with similarity, and is immune to monist distortion. 


Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. 


Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. 


When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. 


Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs might ______________ in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights. 


Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is commonly argued, but also full recognition of legitimate and relevant ones.

Protopia is a state of becoming, rather than a destination. 


It is a process. 


In the protopian mode, things are better today than they were yesterday, although only a little better. 


It is incremental improvement or mild progress. 


The “pro” in protopian stems from the notions of process and progress. 


This subtle progress is not dramatic, not exciting. 


It is easy to miss because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as new benefits. 


The problems of today were caused by yesterday’s technological successes, and the technological solutions to today’s problems will cause the problems of tomorrow. 


This circular expansion of both problems and solutions ________________. 


Ever since the Enlightenment and the invention of science, we’ve managed to create a tiny bit more than we’ve destroyed each year. 


But that few percent positive difference is compounded over decades into what we might call civilization. 


Its benefits never star in movies. 


23차시


A large part of what we see is what we expect to see. 


This explains why we “see” faces and figures in a flickering campfire, or in moving clouds. 


This is why Leonardo da Vinci advised artists to discover their motifs by staring at patches on a blank wall. 


A fire provides a constant flickering change in visual information that never integrates into anything solid and thereby allows the brain to engage in a play of hypotheses. 


On the other hand, the wall does not present us with very much in the way of visual clues, and so the brain begins to make more and more hypotheses and desperately searches for confirmation. 


A crack in the wall looks a little like the profile of a nose and suddenly a whole face appears, or a leaping horse, or a dancing figure. 


In cases like these the brain’s visual strategies are _______________.

Digital technology accelerates dematerialization by hastening the migration from products to services. 


The liquid nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to materials. 


But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. 


The reason even solid physical goods — like a soda can — can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. 


The tangible is replaced by intangibles — intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity — that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. 


Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. 


Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if ________________. 


Nouns morph to verbs. 


Hardware behaves like software. 


In Silicon Valley they say it like this: “Software eats everything. ”

Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over time. 


The negative version instructs restraint; the positive encourages intervention. 


One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior. 


While examples of these rules abound, too many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and “Love another as yourself. ” 


Both versions insist on caring for others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or through acts of commission, by actively intervening. 


Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, they _______________. 


The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self-referential. 


Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated.
